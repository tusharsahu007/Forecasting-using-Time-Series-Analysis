    "## Internal Structures of Time Series:\n",
    "Please make sure that you are acquainted with the components of time series. Go through the blogs given below to brush up about them. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Trend:** In which there is no fixed interval and any divergence within the given dataset is a continuous timeline. The trend would be Negative or Positive or Null Trend\n",
    "\n",
    "**Seasonality:** In which regular or fixed interval shifts within the dataset in a continuous timeline. Would be bell curve or saw tooth\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cyclical:** In which there is no fixed interval, uncertainty in movement and its pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "**Irregularity:** Unexpected situations/events/scenarios and spikes in a short time span.\n",

    "### 3. Cyclicity\n",
    "A cyclic pattern exists when data exhibit rises and falls that are not of fixed period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyclical behavior on the other hand can drift over time because the time between periods isnâ€™t precise. For example, the stock market tends to cycle between periods of high and low values, but there is no set amount of time between those fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cyclic pattern exists when data exhibit rises and falls that are not of fixed period. The duration of these fluctuations is usually of at least 2 years. Think of business cycles which usually last several years, but where the length of the current cycle is unknown beforehand.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Residuals(e[t])** means an irregular variation of ts data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring to our model that expresses a time series as a sum of four components, it is\n",
    "noteworthy that in spite of being able to account for the three other components, we might\n",
    "still be left with an irreducible error component that is random and does not exhibit\n",
    "systematic dependency on the time index. This fourth component reflects unexpected\n",
    "variations in the time series. Unexpected variations are stochastic and cannot be framed in a\n",
    "mathematical model for a definitive future prediction. This type of error is due to lack of\n",
    "information about explanatory variables that can model these variations or due to presence\n",
    "of a random noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "When trend and cyclical variations are removed from time-series data, the \n",
    "patterns left behind that cannot be explained are called errors, unexpected \n",
    "variations, or residuals. Various methods are available to check for \n",
    "irregular variations such as probability theory, moving averages, and \n",
    "autoregressive time-series methods. If we can find any cyclic variation in \n",
    "data, it is considered to be part of the residuals. These variations that occur \n",
